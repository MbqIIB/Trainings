Preparing A Drive / Partition / Loop Device for Encryption

# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 

Testing for Encryption Support

# grep -i config_dm_crypt /boot/config-$(uname -r)
# lsmod | grep dm_crypt
# modprobe dm_crypt

Installing Cryptsetup

# yum update && yum install cryptsetup

Setting Up an Encrypted Partition

# cryptsetup --version
# cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/sdb1


# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 my_encrypted_partition

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition

# mkdir /mnt/enc
# mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition /mnt/enc
# mount | grep partition

When you are done writing to or reading from your encrypted file system, simply unmount it
# umount /mnt/enc

and close the LUKS partition using,
# cryptesetup luksClose my_encrypted_partition


Testing Encryption

# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 my_encrypted_partition

   Enter your passphrase

   Mount the partition

   # mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition /mnt/enc
   
   Create a dummy file inside the mount point.
   # echo “This is Part 3 of a 12-article series about the LFCE certification” > /mnt/enc/testfile.txt
   # cat /mnt/enc/testfile.txt
   # umount /mnt/enc
   
   # cryptsetup luksClose my_encrypted_partition
   
Try to mount the partition as a regular file system. It should indicate an error.
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/enc


Encryptin the Swap Space for Further Security

he passphrase you entered earlier to use the encrypted partition is stored in RAM memory while it’s open. 
If someone can get his hands on this key, he will be able to decrypt the data. This is especially easy
to do in the case of a laptop, since while hibernating the contents of RAM are kept on the swap partition.

To avoid leaving a copy of your key accessible to a thief, encrypt the swap partition following these steps:

1 Create a partition to be used as swap with the appropriate size (/dev/sdd1 in our case) and
encrypt it as explained earlier. Name it just “swap” for convenience.’

2.Set it as swap and activate it.

# mkswap /dev/mapper/swap
# swapon /dev/mapper/swap

3. Next, change the corresponding entry in /etc/fstab.

/dev/mapper/swap none        	swap	sw          	0   	0

4. Finally, edit /etc/crypttab and reboot.

swap               /dev/sdd1         /dev/urandom swap


Once the system has finished booting, you can verify the status of the swap space:

# cryptsetup status swap
