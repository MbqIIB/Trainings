Edit /etc/default/nfs-common to enable idmapd

NEED_IDMAPD=YES

And edit /etc/idmapd.conf with your local domain name (the default is the FQDN of the host).
Domain = yourdomain.com

# systemctl start nfs-common 	[systemd based systems]

edit /etc/exports

/filesystem/to/export  client1([options]) clientN([options])

/NFS-SHARE  	192.168.0.17(fsid=0,no_subtree_check,rw,root_squash,sync,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000)
/NFS-SHARE/mydir    	192.168.0.17(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)

# showmount -e [IP or hostname]


# systemctl restart nfs-server

Autofs reads /etc/auto.master, which has the following format:
[mount point]	[map file]

Where [map file] is used to indicate multiple mount points within [mount point].

Edit your /etc/auto.master as follows:
/media/nfs	/etc/auto.nfs-share	--timeout=60

and create a map file named /etc/auto.nfs-share with the following contents:

writeable_share  -fstype=nfs4 192.168.0.10:/
non_writeable_share  -fstype=nfs4 192.168.0.10:/mydir

Note that the first field in /etc/auto.nfs-share is the name of a subdirectory inside /media/nfs.
Each subdirectory is created dynamically by autofs.

Now, restart the autofs service:
# systemctl restart autofs

and finally, to enable autofs to start on boot, run the following command:
# systemctl enable autofs

mount | grep nfs-share
