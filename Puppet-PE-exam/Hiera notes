Hiera - Overview

Principles behind Hiera
Configuring hierarchies
Hiera plugins
Using Hiera from Puppet and the CLI



Hiera is the key/value lookup tool of reference where to store Puppet user data.

It provides an highly customizable way to lookup for parameters values based on a custom hierarchy using many different backends for data storage.

It provides a command line tool hiera that we can use to interrogate direclty the Hiera data and functions to be used inside Puppet manifests: hiera() , hiera_array() , hiera_hash() , hiera_include()

Hiera is installed by default with Puppet version 3 and is available as separated download on earlier version (Installation instructions).

We need Hiera only on the PuppetMaster (or on any node, if we have a masterless setup).

Currently version 1 is available, here is its official documentation


Hiera configuration: hiera.yaml

Hiera's configuration file is in yaml format and is called hiera.yaml here we define the hierarchy we want to use and the backends where data is placed, with backend specific settings.

Hiera's configuration file path is different according to how it's invoked:

From the Command Line and Ruby code
Default path: /etc/hiera.yaml

From Puppet
Default path for Puppet OpenSource: /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml

Default path for Puppet Enterprise: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml

It's good practice the symlink these alternative configuration files in order to avoid inconsistencies when using Hiera from the shell line or within Puppet manifests:

ln -s /etc/hiera.yaml /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml
Default configuration

By default Hiera does not provide a configuration file. The default settings are equivalent to this:

---
:backends: yaml
:yaml:
  :datadir: /var/lib/hiera
:hierarchy: common
:logger: console
