Use the exec resource type instead of Puppet code whenever possible.


True
--False
Correct!

The Puppet exec resource allows you to:

Write modules that are inherently idempotent.
--Access the operating system to execute commands and run scripts.
Disregard idempotency when you write Puppet modules.
Avoid using scripts to execute operating system commands.
Correct!

When you call a script from the exec resource, you need to ensure that the script operates idempotently.

--True
False
Correct!

Any command in an exec resource must:


Use the `onlyif` attribute to restrict run conditions.
Call a script in order to run operating system commands.
Include the `path` attribute.
--Be able to run multiple times without causing harm.
Correct.
