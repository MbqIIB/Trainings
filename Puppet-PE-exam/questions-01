7) Facter is a tool unique only to Puppet

Correct
Correct answer

False

Facter is a stand alone tool that can be installed regardless if Puppet is installed. However, it is also installed during the Puppet installation process on the Puppet master as well as the Puppet agent.

8) The catalog of resource configuration (the modules/class that define the configuration) is compiled on the node that is running Puppet agent

Correct
Correct answer

False
Explanation

The Puppet classes that make up a node are all compiled on the Puppet masted based on the Node Object (facts) from the node making the request. After it is compiled the Puppet agent on the node downloads the catalog and enforces the catalog resources. The reason it is compiled on the Puppet master is to reduce resource overhead on the node at puppet agent runtime.

9) By default when a node first runs Puppet agent and communicates with the puppet master a certificate is created for signing. When the certificate is signed what is the name of the certificate on the Puppet master?

Correct
Correct answer

The nodes/servers current hostname at time of first Puppet agent run on the node
Explanation

The certificate name is based off the nodes hostname at the time the node first runs Puppet agent. The certificate name will always be based off of that nodes hostname even if the nodes hostname changes after the certificate is signed on the puppet master. If the nodes hostname was originally node1.mylabserver.com when the certificate is signed and the hostname changed to node2.mylabserver.com after the signing of the certificate then the certificate name on the Puppet master will still be node1.mylabserver.com.
